 abstract = {This paper presents the development of a self-tuned HVAC controller that provides customized thermal conditions to satisfy occupant preferences (i.e., online learning) while minimizing energy consumption, and the implementation of this controller in a real occupied office space. The evolution of personalized thermal preference models and the delivery of thermal conditions with model predictive control (MPC) form a closed-loop. To integrate these two parts, we propose a new method that always provides a set of lower and upper indoor temperature bounds. Different from ad hoc rules proposed in previous research, the control bounds are based on a decision-making method that minimizes the expected cost. We implemented the self-tuned controller in an actual open-plan office space conditioned with a radiant floor cooling system with eight independently controlled loops. Localized operative temperature bounds in each radiant floor loop were determined based on occupantsâ€™ feedback and personalized thermal preference models, developed using a Bayesian clustering and online classification algorithm. The self-tuned controller can decrease occupant dissatisfaction compared to a baseline MPC controller, tuned based on general comfort bounds. To generalize the findings of this work: (i) we integrated the self-tuned controller with local MPC into a building simulation platform using synthetic occupant profiles, and (ii) demonstrated a method for automatic system adjustment based on comfort-energy trade-off tuning. In this way, decisions resulting in energy waste or occupant dissatisfaction are eliminated, i.e., the energy is deployed where it is actually needed.},
