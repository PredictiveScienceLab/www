	abstract = {While existing mathematical descriptions can accurately account for phenomena at microscopic scales (e.g., molecular dynamics), these are often high-dimensional, stochastic, and their applicability over macroscopic time scales of physical interest is computationally infeasible or impractical. In complex systems, with limited physical insight on the coherent behavior of their constituents, the only available information is data obtained from simulations of the trajectories of huge numbers of degrees of freedom over microscopic time scales. The analysis of these large amounts of data hinges upon the ability to efficiently extract meaningful latent properties and to discover reduced, predictive descriptions. This paper discusses a Bayesian approach to deriving probabilistic coarse-grained models that simultaneously addresses the problems of identifying appropriate reduced coordinates and the effective dynamics in this lower-dimensional representation. At the core of the models proposed lie simple, low-dimensional dynamical systems which serve as the building blocks of the global model. These approximate the latent generating sources and parametrize the reduced-order dynamics. On their own, each of these simple models would be unable to explain and predict the various complexities encountered in multiscale dynamics of physical interest. Similar to the way one would synthesize opinions from various experts in order to reach a conclusion, we propose probabilistic models that combine the predictions of all these building blocks in order to obtain an integrated model that provides a good global approximation. We discuss parallelizable, online inference and learning algorithms that employ sequential Monte Carlo samplers and scale linearly with the dimensionality of the observed dynamics. We propose a Bayesian adaptive time-integration scheme that utilizes probabilistic predictive estimates and enables rigorous concurrent simulation over macroscopic time scales. The data-driven perspective advocated assimilates computational and experimental data and thus can materialize data-model fusion. It can deal with applications that lack a mathematical description and where only observational data is available. Furthermore, it makes nonintrusive use of existing computational models.},

	abstract = {Uncertainty propagation in flow through porous media problems is a challenging problem. This is due to the high-dimensionality of the random property fields, e.g. permeability and porosity, as well as the computational complexity of the models that are involved. The usual approach is to construct a surrogate response surface and then use it instead of the expensive model to carry out the uncertainty propagation task. However, the construction of the surrogate surface is hampered by various aspects such as the limited number of model evaluations that one can afford, the curse of dimensionality, multi-variate responses with non-trivial correlations, potential localized features of the response and/or discontinuities. In this work, we extend upon the concept of the Multi-output Gaussian Process (MGP) to effectively deal with all of these difficulties simultaneously. This non-trivial extension involves an infinite mixture of MGP's that is trained using variational Bayesian inference. Prior to observing any data, a Dirichlet process is used to generate the components of the MGP mixture. The Bayesian nature of the model allows for the quantification of the uncertainties due to the limited number of simulations, i.e., we can derive error bars for the statistics of interest. The automatic detection of the mixture components by the variational inference algorithm is able to capture discontinuities and localized features without adhering to ad hoc constructions. Finally, correlations between the components of multi-variate responses are captured by the underlying MGP model in a natural way.},

	abstract = {Farming is using more of the land surface, as population increases and agriculture is increasingly applied for non-nutritional purposes such as biofuel production. This agricultural expansion exerts an increasing impact on the terrestrial carbon cycle. In order to understand the impact of such processes, the Community Land Model (CLM) has been augmented with a CLM-Crop extension that simulates the development of three crop types: maize, soybean, and spring wheat. The CLM-Crop model is a complex system that relies on a suite of parametric inputs that govern plant growth under a given atmospheric forcing and available resources. CLM-Crop development used measurements of gross primary productivity (GPP) and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) from AmeriFlux sites to choose parameter values that optimize crop productivity in the model. In this paper, we calibrate these parameters for one crop type, soybean, in order to provide a faithful projection in terms of both plant development and net carbon exchange. Calibration is performed in a Bayesian framework by developing a scalable and adaptive scheme based on sequential Monte Carlo (SMC). The model showed signiﬁcant improvement of crop productivity with the new calibrated parameters. We demonstrate that the calibrated parameters are applicable across alternative years and different sites.},

The evolution of personalized thermal preference models and the delivery of thermal conditions with model predictive control (MPC) form a closed-loop. To integrate these two parts, we propose a new method that always provides a set of lower and upper indoor temperature bounds. Different from ad hoc rules proposed in previous research, the control bounds are based on a decision-making method that minimizes the expected cost. We implemented the self-tuned controller in an actual open-plan office space conditioned with a radiant floor cooling system with eight independently controlled loops. Localized operative temperature bounds in each radiant floor loop were determined based on occupants’ feedback and personalized thermal preference models, developed using a Bayesian clustering and online classification algorithm. The self-tuned controller can decrease occupant dissatisfaction compared to a baseline MPC controller, tuned based on general comfort bounds. To generalize the findings of this work: (i) we integrated the self-tuned controller with local MPC into a building simulation platform using synthetic occupant profiles, and (ii) demonstrated a method for automatic system adjustment based on comfort-energy trade-off tuning. In this way, decisions resulting in energy waste or occupant dissatisfaction are eliminated, i.e., the energy is deployed where it is actually needed.},

Specifically, we parameterize the posterior using the family of Gaussian mixtures and seek to minimize the information loss incurred by replacing the true posterior with an approximate one. Our approach is of particular importance in underdetermined problems with expensive forward models in which both the classical approach of minimizing a potentially regularized misfit function and MCMC are not viable options.

The main contribution of this work is the reformulation of the Bayesian solution of the inverse problem when the expensive forward model is replaced by the surrogate. We derive three approximations of the reformulated solution with increasing complexity and ﬁdelity. We demonstrate numerically that the proposed approximations capture the uncertainty of the solution of the inverse problem induced by the fact that the forward model is replaced by a ﬁnite number of simulations.

In the first step of our methodology, we conduct field observations of occupants’ perception and satisfaction with the visual environment when exposed to variable daylight and electric light conditions, and we collect data from room sensors, shading and light dimming actuators. Consequently, we formulate a Bayesian classification and inference model, using the Dirichlet Process (DP) prior and multinomial logistic regression, to develop probability distributions of occupants’ preference, such as prefer darker, prefer brighter, or satisfied with current conditions. Based on field observations, we encode within the model structure that occupants’ visual preferences are influenced by a combination of measured physical and control state variables describing the luminous environment, as well as latent human characteristics. The latter represent hidden random variables used to determine the optimal number of possible clusters of individuals with similar visual preference characteristics in the studied office building population. In the final step, we learn the visual preferences of new occupants in the dataset, by inferring their cluster values, and we derive the personalized profiles, using a mixture of the general probabilistic sub-models.},

	abstract = {State-of-the-art computer codes for simulating real physical systems are often characterized by vast number of input parameters. Performing uncertainty quantification (UQ) tasks with Monte Carlo (MC) methods is almost always infeasible because of the need to perform hundreds of thousands or even millions of forward model evaluations in order to obtain convergent statistics. One, thus, tries to construct a cheap-to-evaluate surrogate model to replace the forward model solver. For systems with large numbers of input parameters, one has to address the curse of dimensionality through suitable dimensionality reduction techniques. A popular class of dimensionality reduction methods are those that attempt to recover a low-dimensional representation of the high-dimensional feature space. However, such methods often tend to overestimate the intrinsic dimensionality of the input feature space. In this work, we demonstrate the use of deep neural networks (DNN) to construct surrogate models for numerical simulators. We parameterize the structure of the DNN in a manner that lends the DNN surrogate the interpretation of recovering a low-dimensional nonlinear manifold. The model response is a parameterized nonlinear function of the low-dimensional projections of the input. We think of this low-dimensional manifold as a nonlinear generalization of the notion of the active subspace. Our approach is demonstrated with a problem on uncertainty propagation in a stochastic elliptic partial differential equation (SPDE) with uncertain diffusion coefficient. We deviate from traditional formulations of the SPDE problem by lifting the assumption of fixed lengthscales of the uncertain diffusion field. Instead we attempt to solve a more challenging problem of learning a map between an arbitrary snapshot of the diffusion field and the response.},

A personalized shading control framework is developed to maximize occupant satisfaction while minimizing lighting energy use in daylit offices with automated shading systems. Personalized visual satisfaction utility functions were used along with model-predicted lighting energy use to form an optimization framework using two approaches. In the multi-objective optimization scheme, the satisfaction utility and predicted lighting energy consumption are used as parallel objectives to provide a set of Pareto solutions at each time step. In the single-objective optimization scheme, the satisfaction utility is converted into a constraint when minimizing lighting energy use. A simulation study with two distinct visual satisfaction models, inferred from experimental data, was conducted to evaluate the implementation feasibility and optimization effectiveness. Daily and annual simulation results are presented to demonstrate the different patterns of optimal points depending on preference profiles, occupant sensitivity to utility function, and exterior conditions. Finally, we present a new way to apply the multi-objective optimization without assigning arbitrary weights to objectives: allowing occupants to be the final decision makers in real-time balancing between their personalized visual satisfaction and energy use considerations, within dynamic hidden optimal bounds. A slider is introduced as a dynamic user interface with mapped and sorted optimal solutions.},

	abstract = {Many decisions within engineering systems design are typically made by humans. These decisions significantly affect the design outcomes and the resources used within design processes. While decision theory is increasingly being used from a normative standpoint to develop computational methods for engineering design, there is still a significant gap in our understanding of how humans make decisions within the design process. Particularly, there is lack of knowledge about how an individual's domain knowledge and framing of the design problem affect information acquisition decisions. To address this gap, the objective of this paper is to quantify the impact of a designer's domain knowledge and problem framing on their information acquisition decisions and the corresponding design outcomes. The objective is achieved by (i) developing a descriptive model of information acquisition decisions, based on an optimal one-step look ahead sequential strategy, utilizing expected improvement maximization, and (ii) using the model in conjunction with a controlled behavioral experiment. The domain knowledge of an individual is measured in the experiment using a concept inventory, whereas the problem framing is controlled as a treatment variable in the experiment. A design optimization problem is framed in two different ways: a domain-specific track design problem and a domain-independent function optimization problem (FOP). The results indicate that when the problem is framed as a domain-specific design task, the design solutions are better and individuals have a better state of knowledge about the problem, as compared to the domain-independent task. The design solutions are found to be better when individuals have a higher knowledge of the domain and they follow the modeled strategy closely.},

	abstract = {Excessive mechanical stress following surgery can lead to delayed healing, hypertrophic scars, and even skin necrosis. Measuring stress directly in the operating room over large skin areas is not feasible, and nonlinear finite element simulations have become an appealing alternative to predict stress contours on arbitrary geometries. However, this approach has been limited to generic cases, when in reality each patient geometry and procedure are unique, and material properties change from one person to another. In this manuscript, we use multi-view stereo to capture the patient-specific geometry of a 7-year-old female undergoing cranioplasty and complex tissue rearrangement. The geometry is used to setup a nonlinear finite element simulation of the reconstructive procedure. A key contribution of this work is incorporation of material behavior uncertainty. The finite element simulation is computationally expensive, and it is not suitable for uncertainty propagation which would require many such simulations. Instead, we run only a few expensive simulations in order to build a surrogate model by Gaussian process regression of the principal components of the stress fields computed with these few samples. The inexpensive surrogate is then used to compute the statistics of the stress distribution in this patient-specific scenario.},

	abstract = {Predicting mechanical stress contours on skin resulting from local tissue rearrangement surgeries is needed to design optimal treatment plans and avoid wound healing complications. Finite element (FE) simulations of skin tissues have been shown to be a reliable tool in preoperative planning, yet, a major obstacle in the creation of predictive software comes from the inherent uncertainty in material properties of biological materials, and the high computational cost of creating and calibrating virtual surgery models. In this study we build computationally inexpensive surrogates to easily predict stress profiles for arbitrary material parameters and a range of defect sizes in three reconstructive scenarios: advancement, transposition, and rotation flaps. The surrogates are built by first creating a training data set of FE simulations that cover the input space of experimentally-determined skin properties from the literature. A reduced order representation of the training data set is achieved via principal component analysis, and computationally efficient surrogates are then created through Gaussian Process (GP) regression. We show that the GP surrogates predict stress contours with relative errors that are on average 2\% in the l2-norm compared to the high-fidelity FE models. We apply the GP surrogates to predict differences in the probability densities of stress contours between two different age groups undergoing the same procedure. By replacing nonlinear FE models with accurate yet inexpensive models that can be evaluated for any combination of human skin material parameters and a range of defect sizes, we aim to enable calibration and prediction of stress contours in individualized clinical cases in the near future.},

The model yields probabilistic estimates of the irradiation field every thirty minutes starting from two consecutive satellite measurements. The probabilistic nature of the model captures prediction uncertainties and can therefore be used by solar energy producers to quantify the operation risks. The model is simple to implement and can make predictions in realtime with minimal computational resources. To deal with the high-dimensionality of the satellite data, we construct a reduced representation using factor analysis. Then, we model the dynamics of the reduced representation as a discrete (30-min interval) dynamical system. In order to convey information about the movement of the irradiation field, the dynamical system has a two-step delay. The dynamics are represented in a nonlinear, nonparametric way by a recursive Gaussian process. The predictions of the model are compared with observed satellite data as well as with a similar model that uses only ground observations at the prediction site. We conclude that using satellite data in an area including the prediction site significantly improves the prediction compared with models using only ground observation site data.},

It offers rigorous convergence diagnostics even though history dependent, non-Markovian dynamics are employed. It makes use of a greedy optimization scheme in order to obtain sparse representations of the free energy function which can be particularly useful in multidimensional cases. It employs embarrassingly parallelizable sampling schemes that are based on adaptive Sequential Monte Carlo and can be readily coupled with legacy molecular dynamics simulators. The sequential nature of the learning and sampling scheme enables the efficient calculation of free energy functions parametrized by the temperature.

	abstract = {Uncertainty quantification (UQ) tasks, such as model calibration, uncertainty propagation, and optimization under uncertainty, typically require several thousand evaluations of the underlying computer codes. To cope with the cost of simulations, one replaces the real response surface with a cheap surrogate based, e.g., on polynomial chaos expansions, neural networks, support vector machines, or Gaussian processes (GP). However, the number of simulations required to learn a generic multivariate response grows exponentially as the input dimension increases. This curse of dimensionality can only be addressed, if the response exhibits some special structure that can be discovered and exploited. A wide range of physical responses exhibit a special structure known as an active subspace (AS). An AS is a linear manifold of the stochastic space characterized by maximal response variation. The idea is that one should first identify this low dimensional manifold, project the high-dimensional input onto it, and then link the projection to the output. If the dimensionality of the AS is low enough, then learning the link function is a much easier problem than the original problem of learning a high-dimensional function. The classic approach to discovering the AS requires gradient information, a fact that severely limits its applicability. Furthermore, and partly because of its reliance to gradients, it is not able to handle noisy observations. The latter is an essential trait if one wants to be able to propagate uncertainty through stochastic simulators, e.g., through molecular dynamics codes. In this work, we develop a probabilistic version of AS which is gradient-free and robust to observational noise. Our approach relies on a novel Gaussian process regression with built-in dimensionality reduction. In particular, the AS is represented as an orthogonal projection matrix that serves as yet another covariance function hyper-parameter to be estimated from the data. To train the model, we design a two-step maximum likelihood optimization procedure that ensures the orthogonality of the projection matrix by exploiting recent results on the Stiefel manifold, i.e., the manifold of matrices with orthogonal columns. The additional benefit of our probabilistic formulation, is that it allows us to select the dimensionality of the AS via the Bayesian information criterion. We validate our approach by showing that it can discover the right AS in synthetic examples without gradient information using both noiseless and noisy observations. We demonstrate that our method is able to discover the same AS as the classical approach in a challenging one-hundred-dimensional problem involving an elliptic stochastic partial differential equation with random conductivity. Finally, we use our approach to study the effect of geometric and material uncertainties in the propagation of solitary waves in a one dimensional granular system.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we present a hierarchical Bayesian approach to model human interactions with motorized roller shades and dimmable electric lights. At the top level of hierarchy, Bayesian multivariate binary-choice logit models predict the probability of shade raising/lowering actions as well as the actions to increase the level of electric light. At the bottom level, Bayesian regression models with built-in physical constraints estimate the magnitude of actions, and hence the corresponding operating states of shading and electric lighting systems. The models are based on a dataset from a field study conducted in private offices designed to facilitate a large number of participants and to collect data on environmental parameters as well as individual characteristics and human attributes governing human-shading and – electric lighting interactions. In this study, models were developed only for arrival periods due to the low frequency of actions during intermediate time intervals with continuous occupation. Our modeling framework demonstrates the advantages of the Bayesian approach that captures the epistemic uncertainty in the model parameters, which is important when dealing with small-sized datasets, a ubiquitous issue in human data collection in actual buildings; it also enables the incorporation of prior beliefs about the systems; and offers a systematic way to select amongst different models using the Bayes factor and the evidence for each model. Our findings reveal that besides environmental variables, human attributes are significant predictors of human interactions, and improve the predictive performance when incorporated as features in shading action models.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a new data-driven method for learning personalized thermal preference profiles, by formulating a combined classification and inference problem, without developing different models for each occupant. Different from existing approaches, we developed a generalized thermal preference model in which our main hypothesis, “Different people prefer different thermal conditions”, is explicitly encoded. The approach is fully Bayesian, and it is based on the premise that the thermal preference is mainly governed by (i) an overall thermal stress, represented using physical process equations with relatively few parameters along with prior knowledge of the parameters, and (ii) the personal thermal preference characteristic, which is modeled as a hidden random variable. The concept of clustering occupants based on this hidden variable, i.e., similar thermal preference characteristic, is introduced. The results, based on a dataset collected from a typical office building population, show clear evidence of the existence of multi-clusters; in particular, the 5-cluster model performed best compared to 2, 3 and higher cluster models using the studied dataset. Subsequently, the thermal preference of a new occupant in the dataset is inferred by using a mixture of the general sub-models for each cluster. The results show that the method developed in this study provides accurate predictions for personalized thermal preference profiles and it is efficient as it only requires a relatively small dataset collected from each occupant. The approach presented in this paper is a significant step towards personalized environments in office buildings using real-time feedback from occupants.},

We propose a framework that provides a guideline for designers to evaluate their respective revelation strategies and thus make better decisions when choosing a particular revelation strategy in a design iteration. This framework utilizes concepts from Bayesian updating and quantifies the confidentiality lost and value gained for a particular revelation, providing a mathematical abstraction of the collaborative design process as a sequence of information revelation decisions.

A parametrized Gaussian bell function was adopted for the latent satisfaction utility model, based on our belief that each person has a specific set of neighboring visual conditions that are most preferred. Distinct visual preference profiles were inferred with a Bayesian approach using the experimental data.

Our approach takes into account the uncertainty in solar irradiance forecast over a prediction horizon, using a new probabilistic time series autoregressive model, calibrated on the sky-cover forecast from a weather service provider. In the optimal control formulation, we model the effect of solar irradiance as non-Gaussian stochastic disturbance affecting the cost and constraints, and the nonconvex cost function is an expectation over the stochastic process. To solve this complex optimization problem, we introduce a new approximate dynamic programming methodology that represents the optimal cost-to-go functions using Gaussian process regression, and achieves good solution quality. In the final step, we use an emulator that couples physical system models in TRNSYS with the SMPC controller developed using Python and MATLAB to evaluate the closed-loop operation of a building-integrated system with a solar-assisted heat pump coupled with radiant floor heating. For the system and climate under consideration, the SMPC saves up to 44\% of the electricity consumption for heating in a winter month, compared to a baseline well-tuned rule-based controller, and it is robust, imposing less uncertainty on thermal comfort violation.},

	abstract = {Computer codes simulating physical systems usually have responses that consist of a set of distinct outputs (e.g., velocity and pressure) that evolve also in space and time and depend on many unknown input parameters (e.g., physical constants, initial/boundary conditions, etc.). Furthermore, essential engineering procedures such as uncertainty quantification, inverse problems or design are notoriously difficult to carry out mostly due to the limited simulations available. The aim of this work is to introduce a fully Bayesian approach for treating these problems which accounts for the uncertainty induced by the finite number of observations. Our model is built on a multi-dimensional Gaussian process that explicitly treats correlations between distinct output variables as well as space and/or time. The proper use of a separable covariance function enables us to describe the huge covariance matrix as a Kronecker product of smaller matrices leading to efficient algorithms for carrying out inference and predictions. The novelty of this work, is the recognition that the Gaussian process model defines a posterior probability measure on the function space of possible surrogates for the computer code and the derivation of an algorithmic procedure that allows us to sample it efficiently. We demonstrate how the scheme can be used in uncertainty quantification tasks in order to obtain error bars for the statistics of interest that account for the finite number of observations.},

	abstract = {Cluster expansions are simplified, Ising-like models for binary alloys in which vibrational and electronic degrees of freedom are coarse grained. The usual practice is to learn the parameters of the cluster expansion by fitting the energy they predict to a finite set of ab initio calculations. In some cases, experiments suggest that such approaches may lead to overestimation of the phase transition temperature. In this work, we present a novel approach to fitting the parameters based on the relative entropy framework which, instead of energies, attempts to fit the Boltzmann distribution of the configurational degrees of freedom. We show how this leads to T-dependent parameters.},

	abstract = {Bayesian inference techniques have been used extensively in recent years for parameter estimation in nonlinear systems. Despite the many advances made in the field, highly nonlinear systems can still be challenging to identify. Of key interest is the challenge in establishing the identifiability of the model with respect to various excitation signals and, in particular, doing so prior to the collection of experimental data. Global sensitivity analysis techniques provide a perspective on this problem that is well-suited to informing the design of identification experiments for use with Bayesian inference techniques. These methods quantify the relative importance of the parameters to the model response by decomposing the variance of the response into contributions from the respective parameters. The sensitivities obtained provide a valuable indication of the information available for parameter estimation in the response of a system to a particular excitation. In this study, nonlinear model parameters are identified based on experimental responses from a nonlinear energy sink device with the unscented Kalman filter. The experimental identification results are compared with those of a Sobol’ sensitivity analysis on the system model to demonstrate how global sensitivity analysis can be used as a method to preselect experimental excitations for use with Bayesian inference techniques.},

	abstract = {The physical models governing surfactant-polymer (SP) flooding process are subject to parametric uncertainties, accurate quantification of which is crucial for improved decision making. Moreover, history matching of SP flooding is an ill-posed problem, typically characterized by a multimodal posterior distribution of these model parameters. This paper presents a systematic approach for Bayesian history matching and uncertainty quantification in the model calibration stage of SP flooding using coreflood experimental data. The approach is as follows. First, we construct a surrogate of the computationally expensive physics-based model using a polynomial chaos expansion (PCE-proxy). Second, we formulate a Bayesian calibration problem for inferring the model parameters from a single coreflood experiment that measures pressure drop and oilcut profiles. Third, we solve the Bayesian calibration problem by sampling directly from the posterior using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). We validate the calibrated parameters by successfully predicting the result of two other coreflood experiments. Then, we extend this framework to stochastic multiobjective optimization of injection slug size design under uncertainties in model parameters (captured by the posterior of Bayesian calibration problem) and oil price (modeled as a geometric random walk with constant drift and volatility). To identify the Pareto frontier of the stochastic multiobjective optimization problem, we employ a variant of Bayesian global optimization (BGO), a class of algorithms capable of optimizing black-box, gradient-free, computationally expensive functions. In particular, we use the extended expected improvement over the dominated hypervolume to sequentially select simulations that seek to reveal the Pareto frontier. An addendum of the implemented BGO is that it quantifies the epistemic uncertainty about the Pareto frontier as induced by the limited number of simulations used to construct it.},
