The long-term goal of this project is to establish a class of material systems with the intrinsic ability to compute contact problems by coupling self-shaping into a deformed shape to the distributed value of electrical conductance. To achieve this, the overall objective of this proposal is to establish such a hybrid material exhibiting self-shaping in response to external pressures that are transduced into an integral value of conductance, which in turn correlates to the spatial distribution of the external pressure.
