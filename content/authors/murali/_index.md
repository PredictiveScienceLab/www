Murali is a mechanical engineering PhD student at Purdue. His current research interests are an eclectic mix of autonomous control, deep learning, and machine teaching. He is particularly interested in developing machine learning algorithms which learns and understands physics from data. As a part of his PhD, he is developing a resilient-autonomous health management system for deep-space habitats at the NASA-funded STRI, [RETHi][1]

He hails from Kerala, the southern-most state in India, and joined Purdue for his graduate studies in Fall 2017.
